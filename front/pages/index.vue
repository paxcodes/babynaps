        about schedules, looking at
        <span class="footnote">conflicting nap charts<sup>1</sup></span
        >, and making schedules from different generators, I am convinced that I
        cannot simply blindly follow a schedule generated for me by some random
        website. And yes, I learned that every baby is indeed different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I built this schedule <em>maker</em>. It will generate an
        initial schedule that you can adjust according to your needs because
        <em> you</em> know your baby best. There will be a handy chart of nap
        needs based on different medical studies to guide you as you make your
        schedule. Have fun!
      </p>
      <ol class="caption">
        <li>
          One chart says maximum awake time for my 7 month old is 2 hours, and
          another says my baby can go as long as 3 hours. Yup.
